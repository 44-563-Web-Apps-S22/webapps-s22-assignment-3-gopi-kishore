    <h1>CODE DISPLAY</h1>
    <blockquote cite="https://cp-algorithms.com/index.html">
        Given two non-negative integers and , we have to find their GCD (greatest common divisor), i.e. the largest
        number which is a divisor of both and . It's commonly denoted by . Mathematically it is defined as:

        (here the symbol "" denotes divisibility, i.e. "" means " divides ")

        When one of the numbers is zero, while the other is non-zero, their greatest common divisor, by definition, is
        the second number. When both numbers are zero, their greatest common divisor is undefined (it can be any
        arbitrarily large number), but we can define it to be zero. Which gives us a simple rule: if one of the numbers
        is zero, the greatest common divisor is the other number.

        The Euclidean algorithm, discussed below, allows to find the greatest common divisor of two numbers and in .

        The algorithm was first described in Euclid's "Elements" (circa 300 BC), but it is possible that the algorithm
        has even earlier origins.
