    <h1>SEATTLE SKYCATS</h1>
    <p>SkyCat (a portmanteau of "Sky Catamaran") is a class of proposed heavy-lift hybrid airships which derive more than half of their lift by helium buoyancy and the balance via aerodynamic lift produced by aerodynamic shaping.[citation needed] The SkyCat design incorporates hover cushion technology in place of wheels, allowing craft to take off and land anywhere, including remote regions without need for airports or sophisticated forward based infrastructure.[1]

        The SkyKitten,[2] a 1/6 linear scale model of a SkyCat design was built and flown by Advanced Technologies Group (ATG) (now-defunct successor to Airship Industries) in the United Kingdom at Cardington.[3]</p>

        <ul>
            <li>"SkyFreighter" is the name given by the Hybrid Air Vehicles to one of its implementations of the SkyCat design</li>
            <li>The Skycat is almost impervious to light ordnance, such as automatic rifle or mortar fire, which will merely pass through the metallized PET film envelope without causing critical helium loss</li>
            <li>SkyCat air vehicle developments are being pursued by at least one major aerospace company.</li>
        </ul>
